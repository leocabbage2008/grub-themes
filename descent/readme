How to use this theme with your grub-bootloader.

Be sure that your graphics-Resolution is able to use the resolution of 1024x768 by running 
the command "vbeinfo" at grub-shell.

 1. extract all files to "/boot/grub/themes/descent"
 2. edit the file "/etc/default/grub" and change/add following lines
  * GRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768
  * GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/descent/theme.txt"
 3. run "update-grub" with root-previlegs (on Ubuntusystems use "sudo update-grub")
 4. reboot
 5. look at your new awesome Bootmenu
